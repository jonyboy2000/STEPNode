<h2><a name=oview></a>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <b>Feature</b> class is used to create manufacturing features. The
features include holes, pockets and outside profiles as well as
generic features defined by a boundary loop or by a set of faces on a
part. The features made by the Feature object are compatible with all
of the STEP-Manufacturing standards.

<p>Other sources of feature data include AP-219, AP-224 and AP-238
files. If the data comes from an external source then your application
will probably need to find and query its features and the Finder
object contains API functions for manipulating the features created by
the Feature object as well as those found in AP-219, AP-224 and AP-238
files.


<!-- ================================ -->
<h2 class=rule><a name=AddFace></a>AddFace()</h2>
<pre>
void <b>AddFace</b> (
	System::Int64 ws_id,
	System::Int64 face_id
	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>AddFace()</b> function 


<!-- ================================ -->
<h2 class=rule><a name=Arc></a>Arc()</h2>
<pre>
void <b>Arc</b> (
	System::String^ label,
	double x,
	double y,
	double z,
	double cx,
	double cy,
	double cz,
	double radius,
	System::Boolean ccw
	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>Arc()</b> function adds an arc to a profile. Profiles
describe the perimeter of a feature. They can be open or closed. The
internal geometry of a profile is very similar to that of a tool
path. Profiles are created by making a series of calls to the Arc
and <a href="#LineTo">LineTo</a> functions.  If a new feature needs to
contain a profile, then that profile should be defined first.

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<DL class=termdefs>
<DT>x, y, z <DD>Coordinates for the end of the arc.
<DT>cx, cy, cz <DD>Coordinates of the center of the circle containing
the arc.
<DT>radius <DD>Radius of the circle containing the arc.
<DT>ccw <DD>If true then the arc moves from the current point to the
new end point in the counter clockwise direction. The current point
will be the end point last defined by an Arc
or <a href="#LineTo">LineTo</a> function.
</DL>

<h3>Related Functions</h3>
<UL>
<li><a href="#LineTo">LineTo</a> Function to make a line or define the
first point of a profile.
<li><a href="#ClosedGeneralPocket">ClosedGeneralPocket</a> Function to
make a pocket using a closed profile.
<li><a href="#OpenGeneralPocket">OpenGeneralPocket</a> Function to
make a pocket using an open profile.
</UL>

<h3>Common Errors</h3>
<UL>
<li>No current point.  A point for the start of the arc must be
defined using the LineTo method before the first arc is made.
</UL>




<!-- ================================ -->
<h2 class=rule><a name=ChangeWorkpiece></a>ChangeWorkpiece()</h2>
<pre>
void <b>ChangeWorkpiece</b> (
	System::String^ piece_name
	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>ChangeWorkpiece()</b> function selects the workpiece in the
current project that will contain the new features defined by the
Feature object. In STEP-NC features are defined on workpieces.

	double diameter
	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>CircularBoss()</b> function adds a circular boss to a
feature. The function defines the diameter and height of the boss and
returns the identity of the new boss.  The placement (origin) of the
boss is defined using the <a href="#SetLocation">SetLocation</a>
function.

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<DL class=termdefs>
<DT>feature_id <DD>The identity of the feature that is to contain the
new boss.
<DT>name <DD> A string name for the boss
<DT>height <DD>The height of the boss from the base.

	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>ClosedCircularOutsideProfile()</b> function creates a type
of feature that describes a volume whose perimeter is to be machined
and returns the id of the new feature.

<P>The name is confusing. It is the opposite of a closed circular
pocket in the sense that for an outside profile the material outside
the feature is machined away and for a closed circular pocket the
material inside the feature is machine away.

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<DL class=termdefs>
<DT>ws_id <DD>The identity of the workingstep that is to use the new
feature as its process feature.
<DT>name <DD>Name (label) for the new feature.
<DT>depth <DD>The depth of the profile from the base.

<pre>
System::Int64 <b>ClosedGeneralOutsideProfile</b> (
	System::Int64 ws_id,
	System::String^ name,
	double depth
	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>ClosedGeneralOutsideProfile()</b> function creates a closed
general outside profile feature and returns the id of the new feature.

<p>The name is confusing. This is a type of feature. It describes a
volume whose perimeter is to be machined. It is the opposite of a
closed general pocket in the sense that for an outside profile the
material outside the feature is machined away and for a closed general
pocket the material inside the feature is machined away.

<p>A general profile is defined by a loop that consists of lines and
arcs. See the <a href="#Arc">Arc</a> and <a href="#LineTo">LineTo</a>
functions for details on how to define a profile. When a closed
general outside profile is defined the current profile will be closed
by connecting the last point in the profile to the first point if they
are not already the same.

<p>When a closed general outside profile is defined the current
profile will be reset to empty and the next call
to <a href="#LineTo">LineTo</a> will define the first point of the
next profile.

<p>As shown in the figure a general outside profile is defined by
moving the profile shape by the distanced defined by the depth in the
direction of the path. In the current the DLL the path is defined
implicitly and will be perpendicular to the plane of the profile.

void <b>LineTo</b> (
	System::String^ label,
	double x,

	);
</pre>

<P>The <b>LineTo()</b> function adds another boundary point to a
profile. Several features including GeneralPockets
GeneralOutsideProfiles and GeneralBosses are defined using a profile
and a depth. The profile defines a boundary for the feature. In the
current DLL the profile can be made up of lines and arcs but in future
versions any type of bounded curve geometry will be allowed.

<p>When the LineTo function is first called for an empty profile it
will define the first point in the profile. After the first point has
been defined subsequent calls to LineTo will create a line to the new
point and calls to <a href="#AddDatum">Arc</a> will create an arc to
the new point.

<p>When a feature that requires a profile is defined the profile will
be finished and a new empty profile will be started for the next
feature. If the feature requires a closed profile then a final line
will be added to the profile if the current last point is not the same
as the first point. If the profile is open then it will be used as is.

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<DL class=termdefs>
<DT>name <DD>If this is the first point in a new profile then the
given name will be used to label the profile.
<DT>xyz <DD>Coordinates of the first point in the profile or the next

process feature has been captured as a final feature.

<p>The functions in the Feature object create process features for
workingsteps that are given as arguments to the functions &ndash; see
for
example <a href="#ClosedRectangularPocket">ClosedRectangularPocket</a>. A
second type of feature called the Final Feature is also allowed in
STEP-NC.

<p>A process feature defines a data volume that is to be removed by
the operation defined in a workingstep. A final feature defines a
characteristic of the workpiece that is a target of the operations
defined in a workplan.  For example, in the figure below one of the
final features is an open slot. Two process features are machined to
make this open slot. The closed slot is made in workingstep #1. The
open slot is completed in workingstep #2 by machining the step.

<p align=center><img src="images/feature006.png">

<p>Sometimes the same feature is used as both a process feature and a
final feature for a workingstep. This is shown in the figure where the
step is both a process feature and a final feature for wokingstep #2.
More commonly several operations are necessary to create a final
feature. For example, both workingsteps have the open slot as a final
feature because both operations are contributing to the machining of
that final feature.

<p>A STEP-NC program for machining only needs to define process
features. However, a STEP-NC program for machining and measurement may
need to define both types of features because the final features
represent required characteristics of the final part. Typically they
will be defined in CAD, not CAM, and they will include dimensions and
tolerances that can be evaluated using measurement systems.
